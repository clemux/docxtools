Tools for dealing with annoying docx files. Written for my personal
use, do not trust it.

extract_pdfs
============

Quick&dirty script for extracting embedded PDF files from a DOCX
document. Will probably not work with your own files, but you can ping
me (clement@mux.me) or create an issue in the bug tracker.

usage
-----

./extract_pdfs.py <path to file.docx>

Will extracts all embedded PDFs in current directory.

TODO
----

 - Use pdfminer or some other library to automatically name the PDF files.
 - some error handling
